Hi team,

The prospect has been trying to integrate with Jira following the instruction here.

But they are not seeing any results in Jira for the test scripts that they have been executing in Katalon. 
The integration is partially working because they able to pull test cases in from jira to katalon, but they do not see any results being passed back to jira.

Would it be possible jump on the call with them to help with this as this is the only last piece of decision making for them?

Or if you need any further info, please let me know.</description>
